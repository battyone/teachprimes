### Some code to for teaching primes 

This code generates figures for teaching multiplication, division and primes. Used to teach my daughters.

It is heavily inspired by the board game [Prime Climb](http://primeclimbgame.com/) 👍.


If you are new to python and just want to make it run, then I suggest you install anaconda 3, open teachprimes.py in spyder, and run the code from that.
